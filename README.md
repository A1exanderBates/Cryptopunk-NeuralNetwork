## Cryptopunk Convolutional Neural Network
You might have heard of the recent NFT (non-fungible token) craze. Cryptopunks are an example of NFT assets that one can buy. In March of 2021, the cheapest Cryptopunk was worth over $40,000 dollars. The punks each have attributes, like a mustache or hairstyle. This project was a means to explore convolutional neural networks using a 10,000 x 10,000 pixel image and TensorFlow. I will trained the convolutional neural network to classify cryptopunks by attributes.

Note (10/6/21): There appears to be an issue on GitHub's backend with rendering ipynb files. Therefore, [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SXJKznTnbIYfBPL9fkgUkxnZBfd8KYEw?usp=sharing) is a copy that can be viewed in Google Colab.
